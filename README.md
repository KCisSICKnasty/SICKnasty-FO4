# SICKnasty - FO4

Fallout 4 is a very special game to me. It came out while I was in community college. At the time, I only had Xbox 360 which I used to play Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas.
FO4 actually inspired me to build a PC. I even told the guy that helped me get parts, "This PC will be so I can play Fallout 4." I've put hundreds upon hundreds of hours into
the vanilla game. When the show came out, it got me wanting to play again, but the next gen content was such a tease (I finished it all in less than a few hours). Then I
remembered...I got a PC for a reason.

Many wild failures as I learned first hand how modding worked later, we've landed here. Welcome to the sickest and nastiest Fallout 4 experience you've ever seen.

REQUIREMENTS:

- Fallout 4 (Steam copy)*
- Mod Organizer 2
- Wabbajack
- Patience**

*SICKNASTY - FO4 WILL ONLY WORK FOR STEAM INSTALLATIONS OF THE GAME!!! It requires the NextGen content, but then uses Simple Fallout 4 Downgrader to roll back the update
and keep the content. GOG is not supported, sorry! :(

**This mod list is VERY big. The BA2 limit was hit a long time ago & you'll probably be confused if you try to open it without reading this. Like, "Why didn't I wait forever
for the menu to load? Why is the game not letting me start?" We sacrifice the infinite darkness of waiting for the game to start & show the Bethesda logo in exchange for what
I'd like to call, "watching the Audio load". Once the main menu opens, and you can navigate to settings, do so and you'll notice that you can alter any of them except for
"Audio", which has a loading wheel next to it. When that finishes, only then may you start. It is going to take a long time to load. It is a large list with many large mods in
Loose Files format. The only downside to this is you gotta "watch the Audio load". But it's cool, right?

Wabbajack installation: (copy & pasted from The Midnight Ride website)

- Download the latest Wabbajack.

Launching Fallout 4:

- In MO2, you will see a dropdown menu on the right side, to the left of the "Run" button.
- F4SE should be an executable in this menu. Click it.
- Once selected, click "Run". This is how you should run the game each time. (Alternatively, you could make a F4SE shortcut so you don't have to open MO2 to launch the game)

Settings you must change manually in game:

- Backpacks of the Commonwealth - Set holotape "Remove Armor on PA Entry: Always but keep buffs" (or Auto if Survival) or Carryweight is doubled.

	_Required for Power Armor Handling Improvements - Retain Armor Buffs to work._

MAIM Speed:

- Set Hotkeys to your preference
- Turn on scroll wheel and configure if you would like

VAFS Redux:

- Set activation hotkey
- Set criticals hotkey

Configure anything else to your desire. HUD should be good to go as is, but if there are inconsistencies, do let me know!

Modders Resources:

Included in a separate folder called "modders resources", you will find various files and walkthroughs for every mod in the list. Should you decide to take up the modding
reigns and make your own patch, they're all included for you. (:

THE DEEP DIVE:

This list was made fully with survival mode in mind. It wont hit as hard in normal game. It's okay though, because you can tweak survival mode however you want thanks to
Unlimited Survival Mode - F4SE! So, don't be a scaredy cat!

It's really difficult to try and explain what every single mod does, but I'll point out some of the meat and potatoes that make it special. The SICKnasty core, if you will.

- For perks, a full overall that stitches together True Perks, VAFS, MAIM, and True Damage. I carry over almost everything from VAFS so the mechanic wins, but keep the
requirements that True Perks puts in place so there's no mixup. Anything that touches damage is nerfed with changes carried over from True Damage. Any MAIM conflicts are
taken care of. All of this is done with the SICKnastyPERKmodule.

- Since True Damage makes bullets hurt a lot more, why not more bullets? Munitions & Co. give us tons of new ammunition. Thanks to DJINDO, the new ammo types will play well with
TD also! I'd use Reaper's RobCo mod, but I prefer seeing everything worked out in xEdit for this one specifically. Same reason we're not using the True Damage Easy Load Order
mod.

- "But True Damage & MAIM make the game so hard..." Get Power Armor. Thanks to Bastion, you're now literally covered. Damage wont go through until the piece is broken, and then you'll
only take damage in the specific spot. We've got some nifty mods to make Bastion smart, so Power Armor is more of a necessity.

- Warsaw's Improved factions series serves as a base for a ton of the weapon and armor mods on this list. I've more or less included everything that they can interact with that
doesn't conflict. Raider Overhaul & Raider Gangs Extended, Super Mutant Redux & Forced Evolution, More Feral Ghouls & Feral Ghoul Expansion Pack, We Are the Minutemen & You
and What Army 2...You name it, bud. If the faction exists, it's been overhauled.

- Weapon and Armor mods are plentiful, but I cannot stand chem bench clutter & am not interested in 500 ARs from the real world or CoD. Therefore, any mod that adds a new weapon
or piece of armor/clothing is ran through URP (Unique Replacers Project). This series of mods replaces FO4's vanilla uniques with mods. The mods it uses are stripped of any
crafting capabilities or LL injections, making finding the unique it has replaced the only way to obtain it. This gives a lot of variety to the unique weapons & makes it more
exciting when you find them.

- The only weapons in the list not touched by URP are those included in the WOP (Weapon Overhaul Project). This includes Combined Arms & the Expansion pack, the Service Rifle,
the Wattz Laser Gun, the M1 Garand, the weapons added by Point Lookout, & the 22LR Pistol. The only armor/clothing in the list not touched by URP are included because they
probably interact well with Gasmasks of the Wasteland.

- Speaking of which, there's 2 new resources you need to manage & conditions you need to keep track of. Gasmasks of the Wasteland makes wearing a gas mask a necessity when
traversing the Commonwealth with replacable filters you'll need to keep on hand. Nuclear Winter (WHICH DOES NOT ADD WEATHER TO THE GAME!!!) makes your body temperature
something you'll actually need to keep track of (with realism, so if it's December, well...Boston sucks in the winter...). Keep your character properly dressed and make sure
you keep those hands warm!

- For visual overhauls, we use HappoMatka's "Seen Some Shit" series, nearly all of Halfface's texture replacers, dpillari's HD suite of mods, Omega4D2's Modern Replacer series
(but none of the immersion breaking ones), and DoubleYouC's landscape retextures to name a few. All wrapped up in the warm embrace of Lightweight Lighting - Gloomy Edition.

- Weather? You bet. True Storms combined with Seasons Change tag team all of the atmoshpere. I've used the script included with Seasons Change on the entire load order so you'll
see snow on all of our stuff. You'll hear all kinds of new audio too thanks to the Lost Audio Tweaks suite of mods.

My patches are all esp flagged esl plugins made in xEdit. Most of them are self explanatory (SICKnastyPERKmodule contains all perk related patches, SICKnastyGASMASKmodule
forwards the gasmasks from Gasmasks of the Wasteland into inventories and carries over any NPC changes, etc.).

I'll continue updating this README as I get things in order, but this is the culmination of months spent in front of xEdit, Nexus, Discord, and MO2. If there's a bug, please let me
know and I'll fix it in an update! In a way, you're helping me run this like a beta. I was nervous as all heck to upload this list, but I got the courage to finally do it! I'm a stay
at home dad, so I've got nothing but time to answer questions and resolve issues! (:
