# SICKnasty - FO4
 
Fallout 4 is a very special game to me. It came out while I was in community college. At the time, I only had Xbox 360 which I used to play Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas.
FO4 actually inspired me to build a PC. I even told the guy that helped me get parts, "This PC will be so I can play Fallout 4." I've put hundreds upon hundreds of hours into
the vanilla game. When the show came out, it got me wanting to play again, but the next gen content was such a tease (I finished it all in less than a few hours). Then I
remembered...I got a PC for a reason.

Many wild failures as I learned first hand how modding worked later, we've landed here. Welcome to the sickest and nastiest Fallout 4 experience you've ever seen.

This list was made fully with survival mode in mind. It wont hit as hard in normal game. It's okay though, because you can tweak survival mode however you want thanks to
Unlimited Survival Mode - F4SE! So, don't be a scaredy cat!

It's really difficult to try and explain what every single mod does, but I'll point out some of the meat and potatoes that make it special.

For perks, a full overall that stitches together True Perks, VAFS, MAIM, and True Damage. I carry over almost everything from VAFS so the mechanic wins, but keep the
requirements that True Perks puts in place so there's no mixup. Anything that touches damage is nerfed with changes carried over from True Damage. Any MAIM conflicts are
taken care of. All of this is done with the SICKnastyPERKmodule.

Since True Damage makes bullets hurt a lot more, why not more bullets? Munitions & Co. give us tons of new ammunition. Thanks to DJINDO, the new ammo types will play well with
TD also! I'd use Reaper's RobCo mod, but I prefer seeing everything worked out in xEdit for this one specifically. Same reason we're not using the True Damage Easy Load Order
mod.

"But True Damage makes the game so hard..." Get Power Armor. Thanks to Bastion, you're now literally covered. Damage wont go through until the piece is broken, and then you'll
only take damage in the specific spot. We've got some nifty mods to make Bastion smart, so Power Armor is more of a necessity.

Warsaw's Improved factions series serves as a base for a ton of the weapon and armor mods on this list. I've more or less included everything that they can interact with that
doesn't conflict. Raider Overhaul & Raider Gangs Extended, Super Mutant Redux & Forced Evolution, More Feral Ghouls & Feral Ghoul Expansion Pack, We Are the Minutemen & You
and What Army 2...You name it, bud. If the faction exists, it's been overhauled.

I'll continue updating this as I update the mod list, but this is the culmination of months spent in front of xEdit and MO2. If there's a bug, please let me know and I'll fix
it in an update! In a way, you're helping me run this like a beta. I was nervous as all heck to upload this list, but I got the courage to finally do it! I'm a stay at home
dad, so I've got nothing but time to answer questions and resolve issues! (:
