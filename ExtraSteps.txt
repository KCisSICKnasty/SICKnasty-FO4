NOTE: SICKNASTY - FO4 WILL ONLY WORK FOR STEAM INSTALLATIONS OF THE GAME!!! We require the NextGen content, but then use Simple Fallout 4 Downgrader to roll back the update
and keep the content. GOG is not supported, sorry! :(

Setting up MO2, BethiniPie, etc.:

Just use The Midnight Ride: https://themidnightride.moddinglinked.com/utilities.html
I can't put it any better. Follow it for the initial installs, but ignore anything about downloading mods into MO2 (you're here because you're downloading a list, right?).
NOTE: The Midnight Ride is the golden standard, in my opinion, for setting up your game to be modded. I'd recommend giving it a look over so you can at least become more
familiar with how to do things in MO2. I won't explain those things here because it would just be me repeating what's said there.

Drag files in [NoDelete] Root Files (the contents, not the actual folder) into Stock Game Root folder and delete the [NoDelete] Root Files folder after.
Drag files in [NoDelete] Data Files (the contents, not the actual folder) into Stock Game/Data folder and delete the [NoDelete] Data Files folder after.
I've included the Creation Club content that the NextGen update includes, but I'm pretty sure it's un-needed since you'll be launching the game and getting it yourself.
It's in Stock Game/mods, a folder called "[NoDelete] Creation Club Content". I couldn't compile the list without excluding it, so if running the downgrader and such gives you
the content in Stock Game/Data, you can safely delete that folder and tell me so I know it's un-needed. (:

Download Combat Drones here: https://storage.icestormng-mods.de/s/EGmEbj6mZ2EK3tY?path=%2F1.1%2FRelease
Drag the zip file into MO2. Enable the mod and plugin.
THIS IS REQUIRED!!! The Complex Sorter plugin-part2 requires it and a Random Encounter Framework patch for Combat Drones is already included for you!
