NOTE: SICKNASTY - FO4 WILL ONLY WORK FOR STEAM INSTALLATIONS OF THE GAME!!! We require the NextGen content, but then use Simple Fallout 4 Downgrader to roll back the update
and keep the content. GOG is not supported, sorry! :(

This mod list is VERY big. The BA2 limit was hit a long time ago & you'll probably be confused if you try to open it without reading this. Like, "Why didn't I wait forever for
the game to load? Why is the game not letting me start?"

We sacrifice the infinite darkness of waiting for the game to start & show the Bethesda logo in exchange for, what I'd like to call, "watching the Audio load".
Once the main menu opens, and you can navigate to settings, do so and you'll notice that you can alter any of them except for "Audio", which has a loading wheel next to it.
When that finishes, only then may you click start. It is going to take a long time to load. It is a large list with many large mods in Loose Files format. The only downside
to this is you gotta "watch the Audio load". But it's cool, right?

Setting up MO2, BethiniPie, etc.:

Just use The Midnight Ride: https://themidnightride.moddinglinked.com/utilities.html

I can't put it any better. Follow it for the initial installs, but ignore everything after "Mod Organizer Downloads" (you're here because you're downloading a list, right?).
The Midnight Ride is the golden standard, in my opinion, for setting up your game to be modded. I'd recommend giving it a look over so you can at least be familiar with how
to do things in MO2. I won't explain those things here because it would just be me repeating what's said there. TMR website is where I learned and it should be where you learn
too! (:
