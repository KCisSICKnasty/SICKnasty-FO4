NOTE: SICKNASTY - FO4 WILL ONLY WORK FOR STEAM INSTALLATIONS OF THE GAME!!! We require the NextGen content, but then use Simple Fallout 4 Downgrader to roll back the update
and keep the content. GOG is not supported, sorry! :(

Stock Game folder demands your attention:

In "Mods" folder-
Drag files in [NoDelete] Creation Club Content (the contents, not the actual folder) into Stock Game/data folder and delete the [NoDelete] Creation Club Content folder after.
Drag files in [NoDelete] Root Files (the contents, not the actual folder) into Stock Game root folder (the one that has fallout4.exe) and delete the [NoDelete] Root Files
folder after.

Setting up MO2, BethiniPie, etc.:

Just use The Midnight Ride: https://themidnightride.moddinglinked.com/utilities.html

I can't put it any better. Follow it for the initial installs, but ignore anything about downloading mods into MO2 (you're here because you're downloading a list, right?).
The Midnight Ride is the golden standard, in my opinion, for setting up your game to be modded. I'd recommend giving it a look over so you can at least be familiar with how
to do things in MO2. I won't explain those things here because it would just be me repeating what's said there. TMR website is where I learned and it should be where you learn
too! (:
