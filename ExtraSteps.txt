Creation Club content:

For some reason, this didn't want to carry over during compiling. So you'll have to re-add it to the Fallout 4 data folder. Super easy!

1. In the "mods" folder (SICKnasty - Portable/mods), you'll find another folder called: "[NoDelete] Creation Club Content"
2. Drag the CONTENTS of the folder (not the actual folder) into the Stock Game/Data folder
3. Delete the "[NoDelete] Creation Club Content" folder in "mods" so the files are now ONLY in the Data folder

The game now has Creation Club content again.
